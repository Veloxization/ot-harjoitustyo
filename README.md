# README
## What is this?
This is a project repository for a uni course. It has the main project as well as other small assignments.
## What's the main project about?
The main project is a small scale detective game developed with Python. A murder mystery scenario is generated at the start of each game and the player can interrogate the NPCs about their actions throughout the night to deduce who the murderer is and when the murder was committed. Further details in [Requirements](https://github.com/Veloxization/ot-harjoitustyo/blob/master/documentation/requirements.md).
**Note: The project will very likely have major bugs at current time! The functionality is not complete yet.**
